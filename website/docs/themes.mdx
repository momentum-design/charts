# Themes

We provide some built-in themes. You can set global theme via below code.

  theme: 'material'
});
```

The following is the built-in themes:

## Customize Theme

Also, we support the function to customize your theme. Once you added a theme as below, you do not need to set it.
That will be set the global theme.

```js
mdw.settings.addTheme('my-theme', ['#00ff00', '#ff0000', '#0000ff']);
```
