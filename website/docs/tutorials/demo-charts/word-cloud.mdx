# Word Cloud

A word cloud, also known as a tag cloud or word or weighted list, is a visual representation of text data where words are displayed in different sizes and colors.

```jsx live
function showComponent() {
  const data = mdwd.wordCloud;
  const options = {};
  return <mdw-chart style={{ height: '500px' }} type="wordCloud" data={JSON.stringify(data)} options={JSON.stringify(options)}></mdw-chart>;
}
```

```json
[{key: "word", value: 110}, {key: "words", value: 90}, ...]
```

```json
{ "word": 100, "words": 90, ... }
```
